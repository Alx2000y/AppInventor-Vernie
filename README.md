# AppInventor-Vernie

This is an App I made with MIT App Inventor 2 for my Android phone.
It allows me to control LEGO BOOST Vernie movement with a basic joystick and to shoot the "cannon" with a button.
The color sensor status is also continuously shown.

Will soon document the process of creating such an app.
